## Workshop Details

**Dates:** 18th and 19th September 2023 

**Registration fee:** 100 Euros 

Thank you for your registration to a EuroBioc2023 workshop.  Your place at the workshop is only confirmed once the payment has been made.  You can do this either via the PayPal "Add to cart" button below (choose this to pay with credit card) or via bank transfer.

## Payment Options

### Important!

Regardless of which payment type you use, please note the following information carefully:  
- If your employer will pay the invoice by bank transfer or reimburse you for the costs, we need the name of the institute/company/university and corresponding full institutional address for the invoice. 
- If you are joining the workshops as a private person and will not get reimbursed by your employer, use your private residential address.

### Credit card (via PayPal)

If you wish to pay with a credit card we are using PayPal to process the transactions. The form for this can be found below.  Please ensure that you provide the name of the person attending the conference in the box below.  This will allow us to match payments and registrations, even if the payment is performed under another name or using an institutional account.  

Please use the "Pay with PayPal" button even if you do not have a PayPal account.  You will be able to pay directly with a credit card on the next page.  Please note the requirements above when completing the billing address.

### Bank transfer

If you prefer to pay via bank transfer please contact us at info(at)bioconductor.org and provide us with the name and address of the participant (please note the address requirements stated above).  You will then be issued with an invoice with the payment details.
