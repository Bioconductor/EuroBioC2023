This code of conduct was developed for the Bioconductor conferences. For more details, see the [Bioconductor Code of Conduct](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/)
<!-- The original Code of Conduct is copy-pasted and quoted below -->

## Social media policy

Images and content from talks, workshops, and posters may be shared publicly through social media (Twitter, etc.). Videos will be released on the [Youtube Bioconductor channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/bioconductor). Please, inform the organizing committee as soon as possible if you don't wish your presentation material to be shared. <!--To avoid confusion, presentations not to be shared should be labeled "Do Not Share" on each slide, as should be posters.-->

## The _Bioconductor_ conference aims to provide a supportive, collegial, and harassment-free environment

_Bioconductor_ is dedicated to providing a supportive, collegial, and harassment-free 
conference experience for everyone, regardless of:
* gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, 
physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. 
* intellectual position: approaches to data analysis, software preferences, coding style, scientific perspective, etc.

The Virtual Event Code of Conduct applies to BioC virtual events and communications, including but not limited to the virtual platform, talks, workshops, poster sessions, social activities, slack, online and social media communications. We do not tolerate harassment, intimidation, or bullying of conference participants. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate in presentations, communications, in online venues, including chats. 

Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference with no refund, 
at the discretion of the conference organizers. 

## Examples of unacceptable harassment, intimidation, and bullying behavior

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Making comments in chats, to an audience or personally, that belittle or demean another person
* Sharing sexual images online
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior 

Intimidation and bullying include, but are not limited to:

* Aggressive or browbeating behavior directed at someone during a public presentation
* Mocking or insulting another person's intellect, work, perspective, or question/comment
* Making reference to someone's gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, 
physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or other personal attributes in the context of a scientific 
discussion
* Deliberately making someone feel unwelcome

### Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. 

Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. 

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related online activities.

### Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. 
Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. 
We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place. 

You can make a report either personally or anonymously. 

#### Anonymous or Non-anonymous Report

You can make an anonymous or non-anonymous report here: [https://tinyurl.com/bioccomplaint](https://tinyurl.com/bioccomplaint). It is a free-form text box that will be forwarded to conference organizers.

We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence. 

#### Personal Report

You can make a personal report with any of the conference anti-harassment committee: Aedin Culhane, Levi Waldron, and Laurent Gatto.

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone, and we won't tell anyone who you are. 

Our team will be happy to help you contact hotel/venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
