text: "Franka Voigt obtained her PhD from EMBL, Germany, where she used structural biology and biochemistry to characterize the molecular mechanisms of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assembly and function. She then moved on to do her postdoctoral work at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel, Switzerland, where she developed single-mRNA imaging methods that allow visualization of RNPs in live cells and 3D organoid model systems. Starting from 2023 she is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Molecular Life Sciences at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. The research in her lab focuses on the investigation of targeting mechanisms that recruit select mRNA transcripts to specific subcellular localizations and aims to understand their contribution to disease. She develops live single-molecule imaging tools and imaging-based spatial transcriptomics assays to combine them with novel 3D organoid model systems. https://voigtlab.org/."
