abstract: "There are quite a few proposed deployment methods for Shiny apps such as:

R package (CRAN/BioC,GitHub)
Running a Shiny-server
Publishing on Shinyapp.io
Posit Connect
ShinyProxy
Docker swarm / Kubernetes
Serverless (AWS Fargate/Lambda, Google Cloud Run, etc.)
The proposed plan is to compare and exchange experiences between these methods and see perhaps what other methods the people in the community are using."
