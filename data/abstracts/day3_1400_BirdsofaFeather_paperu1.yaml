abstract: "Python and R each have their distinct strengths and modern data analysis approaches benefit from leveraging them using cross-language interoperable workflows. In particular, Bioconductor and scverse provide classes, foundational tools, and analysis packages that implement cutting-edge methods for the comprehension and analysis of single-cell omics data. R has a long tradition of interoperability with other languages and Python is no exception, thanks to e.g., the reticulate and basilisk packages. In this Birds-of-a-Feather session, we will discuss practical steps towards greater interoperability between R and Python and specifically between the Bioconductor and scverse projects."
