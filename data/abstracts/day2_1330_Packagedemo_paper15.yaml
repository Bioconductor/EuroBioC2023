abstract: "The iSEE (Interactive SummarizedExperiment Explorer) software package provides a multi-purpose visual interface for exploring data stored in a SummarizedExperiment object, using the shiny framework.  In this package demo, we will provide an overview of its main functionality, centered around a flexible, interactive exploration and interpretation of biological datasets.  Attendees can follow along through vignettes that form the backbone of the presentation and serve as fully worked examples for later inspection and hands-on learning.  In particular, we will touch upon recently developed features in the scope of the iSEE universe, including: modes and additional panels from the iSEEu package; functions for the interactive visualization of differential expression analyses (with iSEEde) and of functional enrichment analyses (with iSEEpathways); deploying custom landing pages to work with collections of datasets (with iSEEindex, and exemplified in iSEEhub). Given the universal adoption of the SummarizedExperiment class and its derivatives across the whole Bioconductor ecosystem, the iSEE package is designed to be a natural solution to explore a wide spectrum of datasets and data types in depth."
