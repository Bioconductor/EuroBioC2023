abstract: "The aim of the RforMassSpectrometry initiative (https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/) is to provide efficient, thoroughly documented, tested and flexible R software for the analysis and interpretation of high throughput mass spectrometry assays. In this software demo, we will demonstrate three software packages that are central for proteomics data analysis.  - The Spectra package [1], that defines an efficient infrastructure for storing and handling mass spectrometry spectra and functionality to subset, process, visualise and compare spectra data.  - The PSMatch package [2] allows to load, process and analyse peptide-spectrum matches, and can, among others, explore and deconvolute the peptide-protein (group) relations using adjacency matrices and connected components.  - The QFeatures package [3] provides infrastructure to management and process quantitative features for high-throughput mass spectrometry assay, in particular so across assay levels (such as precursors, peptide spectrum matches, peptides and proteins or protein groups) in a coherent and tractable format.  We will conclude by illustrating how the MsExperiment package [5] can be used to bundle these three types of data together.  [1] Gatto L et al.
